For businesses that sell products like clothing, it&#8217;s especially important to provide multiple images that showcase the item from various angles. However, manually adding images to each product can be a time-consuming process. Fortunately, Magento 2 allows you to bulk upload images using a <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/\">CSV file</a>, simplifying the process. In addition, you can programmatically add images to your products in Magento 2, and in this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps to do so. So, let&#8217;s explore <strong><em>how to programmatically add image to product in Magento 2</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Programmatically Add Image to Product in Magento 2: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW DO PRODUCT IMAGES IMPACT YOUR CUSTOMER JOURNEY?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding images to the product gallery in Magento 2 can greatly enhance the shopping experience for customers. These images serve as visual introductions to the products and hold significant influence over how customers perceive them. In fact, a staggering 87.6% of respondents consider product images to be key elements in their shopping experience. Moreover, studies show that 75% of online shoppers heavily rely on product photos when making purchasing decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For eCommerce websites built on Magento 2, product images play a pivotal role in improving product descriptions and making them more enticing to visitors. Since customers cannot physically interact with the products, they depend on product images to gain a better understanding of their features and design. By showcasing multiple angles and enabling zoom functionality, you can provide customers with a clearer idea of how well the product will meet their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that uploading poor-quality images can be detrimental to your business as it may deter potential buyers. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the product images you upload are of high quality and effectively present the product from various perspectives. Doing so will help customers develop a better sense of what they are considering purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s visually-oriented world, product images hold substantial power in shaping customer perceptions. Consequently, they have become an indispensable element for any eCommerce store. Now, let&#8217;s explore <strong><em>how To programmatically add images to product gallery in Magento 2</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW TO ADD IMAGE TO PRODUCT PROGRAMMATICALLY IN MAGENTO 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding product images in Magento 2 can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have a large product catalog. While the default method can do the job, a programmatic approach can significantly streamline the process. However, the downside is that it requires some coding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll walk you through the steps to add product images in Magento 2 programmatically. By using the PHP code provided below, you can save time and effort by uploading multiple images to products in one go. So, let&#8217;s get started with the guide on <strong><em>Add Images To Product Programmatically in magento 2</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><strong><em>// Instance of object manager\r\n$objectManager = \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\ObjectManager::getInstance();\r\n/*Add Images To The Product*/\r\n$imagePath = \"sample.png\"; // path of the image\r\n$product->addImageToMediaGallery($imagePath, array('image', 'small_image', 'thumbnail'), false, false);\r\n$product->save();</em></strong>\r\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a possible rewrite: &#8220;To remove product images, you can use the following code:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><strong><em>$productId =  1 ; // Id of product\r\n$product = $objectManager->create('Magento\\Catalog\\Model\\Product')->load($productId);\r\n$productRepository = $objectManager->create('Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\ProductRepositoryInterface');\r\n$existingMediaGalleryEntries = $product->getMediaGalleryEntries();\r\nforeach ($existingMediaGalleryEntries as $key => $entry) {\r\n    unset($existingMediaGalleryEntries&#91;$key]);\r\n}\r\n$product->setMediaGalleryEntries($existingMediaGalleryEntries);\r\n$productRepository->save($product);</em></strong>\r\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TIPS TO OPTIMIZE MAGENTO 2 PRODUCT IMAGE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon successfully adding an image to a product programmatically in Magento 2</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">REDUCE THE FILE SIZE OF YOUR IMAGES</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve the SEO performance of your website, it&#8217;s crucial to reduce the file size of your images as page loading speed plays a vital role in user experience. Google recommends evaluating your page&#8217;s functionality using tools like <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a> and Webpagetest.org to optimize page loading speed. In Magento 2, you can enable the &#8220;Frontend Resizes&#8221; feature to reduce image sizes, but for further acceleration, consider optimizing your images using lossy or lossless compression methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing the file sizes of your images is crucial to ensure swift load times on your website. While high-quality visuals are pivotal for driving online sales, it&#8217;s advisable to avoid uploading hefty image files and using HTML code to shrink them. Instead, offering users the choice to view images in a larger pop-up window or on a separate page is a better approach. It&#8217;s important to remember that image file sizes should stay within the limit of 70KB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another effective technique to enhance page speed is the implementation of lazy loading images. By adopting this method, images load progressively as users scroll, leading to a faster browsing experience overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s explore <strong><em>how you can programmatically add an image to a product in Magento 2</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CHANGE THE FILE FORMATÂ </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to reducing file sizes for images on e-commerce sites, selecting the right file type is crucial. There are various options available, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, and WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent times, WebP has gained popularity due to its ability to maintain high image quality while keeping file sizes small. This format offers several notable advantages specifically for product images:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WebP images load quickly because of their smaller file sizes, leading to faster website loading times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, WebP&#8217;s improved compression helps reduce online storage requirements. This is especially beneficial for Magento 2 sites with a large volume of images and can even contribute to cost savings on web hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, WebP stands out as the only image format that supports transparent backgrounds for PNG files and animation features for GIF files. Moreover, WebP surpasses JPEG in terms of compression, making it an excellent choice for e-commerce sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, leveraging the WebP image format can bring significant benefits, including faster loading times, reduced storage needs, and superior image quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROVIDE AN IMAGE SITEMAP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To boost the SEO performance of a website, it is important to consider the inclusion of an image sitemap. This step plays a vital role in providing search engines with valuable information during the crawling process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An image sitemap proves especially beneficial in guiding search engines to discover images that might otherwise be challenging to locate. When programmatically adding images to products in Magento 2, you have the option to incorporate them into an existing sitemap or create a dedicated sitemap exclusively for images.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WRITE ALT TEXT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-text is an essential aspect of optimizing images for <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo\">SEO</a> and making them more visible to potential customers when they search on Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When an image cannot be displayed on a website, the alt text acts as a substitute and aids search engines in comprehending the image. It is important to optimize the alt text for maximum effectiveness. Including at least one relevant keyword in the alt text can be beneficial, but it is crucial to exercise caution in its usage. The keywords should only be incorporated if they genuinely relate to the image&#8217;s content. Excessive keyword usage may result in search engine penalties, so it&#8217;s best to strike a balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">USE WORDS THAT DESCRIBE THE IMAGE ACCURATELY TO NAME IMAGE FILES</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to <strong><em>How To Programmatically Add Images to Product Gallery in Magento 2</em></strong>, it is recommended to save the image file with a descriptive name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When naming image files, it is crucial to use descriptive phrases that accurately depict the image&#8217;s content. Instead of opting for generic names like &#8220;Image01,&#8221; it is better to use specific terms like &#8220;red-running-shoes.&#8221; This practice aids search engines in identifying the subject of the image based on its file name, which can positively impact your ranking. Furthermore, it is advisable to incorporate a keyword you wish to rank for when naming the image file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is important to avoid excessive keyword usage or lengthy file names, as this may have a negative impact on your ranking. Instead of underscores, which can merge words together, it is recommended to use dashes to separate them. Additionally, it is advisable to exclude articles such as &#8220;the,&#8221; &#8220;a,&#8221; and similar words that do not contribute significant keyword value. By following these guidelines, you can enhance the visibility of your images and improve your SEO performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CONCLUSION</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is essential to optimize the images on your website for better SEO performance and to attract a larger customer base. By effectively reducing the file size of your images, selecting appropriate file types, incorporating an image sitemap, and utilizing alt-text, you can enhance the visibility of your images to both search engines and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, if you want to learn <strong><em>how to programmatically add an image to a product in Magento 2</em></strong>, there are certain steps you can follow. These steps will allow you to automate the process of adding images to your products in the Magento 2 platform. By following this guide, you&#8217;ll be able to seamlessly incorporate images into your product listings in Magento 2, ensuring an engaging and visually appealing experience for your customers.
