This is a question worth considering as it can greatly benefit teams in terms of productivity and collaboration. The advantages of using a containerization platform become more noticeable when working in a team, as it enables the work configuration to be set up quickly, allowing software builds to start being produced in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the Reasons to Set up Magento 2 on Docker?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>If a developer is considering configuring Magento 2 using a containerization platform, the following reasons can help make a decision. <strong><em>What are the Reasons to set up Magento 2 on Docker</em></strong>? Here are some key justifications for setting up Magento software in a containerized environment, it provides a consistent development and testing environment that is portable across different machines, operating systems, and cloud platforms. It enables developers to quickly create and destroy test environments, reducing setup time and increasing productivity. Docker also allows for easier scaling of infrastructure as needed, and simplifies the deployment of updates and changes to the Magento 2 website. Additionally, it provides isolation and security for the application and its dependencies, helping to ensure that the application runs reliably and securely in production. Overall, setting up Magento 2 on Docker can provide numerous benefits for developers and organizations looking to streamline their development and deployment processes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enhancing the development process makes it a seamless experience, and the mobility and flexibility make it perfect for developing Magento 2.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Easy installation and user-friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The software can be installed on a local computer for a quick start to the development.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The reliability of streamlined development greatly benefits PHP-based applications, including Magento.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Installing Magento 2 on Docker: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Local environment setup.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in the configuration process is to secure an account on the Adobe Commerce website. If you already have an account, there is no need to create a new one. Log in to your Adobe Commerce account and create or copy the existing authentication keys. Your account may already have these keys, as it is used for the Magento Marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verify the system requirements.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the specific use case, a paid subscription may be required. Professional users in businesses with 250 employees or more and annual revenue exceeding $10 million cannot use it for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Docker has the following system configuration requirements:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Windows:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The host system for containers can be Windows 11 or Windows 10, including Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11 should be no older than 21H2, Windows 10 should be built 19041 for Home or Pro, and build 18363 for Enterprise or Education editions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operating system should have WSL 2 subsystem installed or <a href=\"https://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/what-is-hyper-v/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyper-V</a>. Windows features for containers must be enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no strict hardware requirements, but the machine should be capable of running WSL 2 on Windows 10 and 11, meaning it should have a 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) support and at least 4GB of RAM. Virtualization should be enabled in the BIOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mac:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The computer should have an Intel x86 processor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.15 or newer (Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 GB of RAM.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VirtualBox 4.3.30 or older must be uninstalled as it is incompatible with Docker.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Owners of Mac computers with Apple M1 ARM processors should use the Rosetta 2 translator to run Docker.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Docker setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To properly configure and run a containerized environment, the Compose tool is necessary. This software utility enables the definition and deployment of multi-container applications. With Compose, a specific YAML file is used to configure the app&#8217;s setup. Then, with a single command line, it is possible to create and start all the defined services. See the list of Compose features for information on its functions. Compose is compatible with all software systems for software development, testing, and production. Check the official documentation for common use cases. The process for using Compose consists of three steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Define your app&#8217;s current configuration using a specific Dockerfile, which can be reused later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Set up all required services for the app to run by using the docker-compose.yml file. This allows running the app in a detached software environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Run the Docker commands to create and compose the app, or launch it using the docker-compose binary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refer to the template for the docker-compose.yml file to use in your configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>version: &#8220;3.9&#8221;&nbsp; # optional since v1.27.0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>services:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;web:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build: .</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ports:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&#8211; &#8220;5000:5000&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volumes:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&#8211; .:/code</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&#8211; logvolume01:/var/log</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;links:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&#8211; redis</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;redis:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image: redis</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>volumes:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;logvolume01: {}</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install it on Mac computers, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Download a local copy of the Docker.dmg file.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app installer by double-clicking on the downloaded Docker installation package and dragging it to the applications folder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to the Applications folder and start it by double-clicking on its Docker.app file.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A Docker menu will appear on the screen with the service conditions and user agreement. Accept the agreement to gain access to it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To install on a desktop Windows computer, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Download the official installation file from the Docker Hub website. It will typically be saved in your browser&#8217;s default download folder, which is the system download folder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Double-click the downloaded file to begin the installation process. Ensure that Hyper-V and WSL 2 are enabled on your system. If they are not, install them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the instructions of the setup wizard to complete the installation, and then click Close.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your current user account doesn&#8217;t have admin access, add it to the &#8220;docker-users&#8221; group. To do this, open the Windows Computer Management tool as an administrator, navigate to Local Users and Groups &gt; Groups &gt; Docker-users, right-click on the option, and add your current user to the Docker group. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To install on a Windows Server, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open an elevated PowerShell by right-clicking on the PowerShell app and selecting &#8220;Run as administrator&#8221;. Confirm the prompt to allow changes to your device.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2. In PowerShell, run the following command to set the required security protocol: [Net.ServicePointManager]:: SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]:: Tls12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Download the latest stable version of Compose (v1.29.2) by running the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>Invoke-WebRequest \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe\" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $Env:ProgramFiles\\Docker\\docker-compose.exe</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: On Windows Server 2019, you can place the Compose executable in $Env:ProgramFiles\\Docker. This directory is included in the system PATH, so you can run the &#8220;docker-compose &#8211;version&#8221; command in the next step without any additional setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install a version other than 1.29.2 of Compose, replace 1.29.2 with the desired version in the command used to download Compose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Verify the installation.</h3>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>docker-compose --version</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><em>docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 01110ad01</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install on a Linux environment, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download the latest stable release of Docker Compose by running the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To install a different version of Compose, replace 1.29.2 with the desired version in the command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make the binary executable by running the following command: </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If the installation of Docker-Compose results in the failure of the &#8220;docker-compose&#8221; command, verify your system&#8217;s PATH. You can also create a symbolic link to the &#8220;/usr/bin&#8221; directory or another directory included in your PATH. An example of this process is:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can install command completion for the bash and zsh shell (optional). To check the success of your installation, run the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>docker-compose –version</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start Docker instance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve reached this step, you&#8217;ll need to open your terminal to the directory where it is located (e.g., /path/to/docker). It&#8217;s time to start your virtual machine. It may take a few minutes for it to download the images, but future startups will only take a few seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start your virtual machine, run the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><em>docker-compose up -d --build</em></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that everything is running according to your plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Procedure for Installing Magento 2 in Docker Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>To access the command line in your Docker web, run the following command: docker exec -it web bash.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once you are in the web document root by using cd /app, it is optional but highly recommended to install the sample data by running php bin/magento sample data: deploy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For step-by-step instructions on how to install Magento 2 via Composer, refer to our article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note &#8211; After setting up a clear Magento installation, you may opt to install any additional extensions such as layered navigation extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>To access your Docker web, use the following command in your command line: docker exec -it web bash.
