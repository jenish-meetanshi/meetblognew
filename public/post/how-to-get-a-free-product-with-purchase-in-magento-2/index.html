<p>If you&#8217;re looking for information on <strong><em>How to Get a </em></strong>Free Product With the Purchase of Another Product in Magento 2, then you&#8217;re in the right place. Although not a novel sales tactic, offering products as gifts with a purchase still holds its effectiveness as everyone loves to receive discounts and additional presents. Utilizing the gift-with-purchase strategy is a simple yet effective way to encourage customers to make more purchases and boost your business.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the concept of enhancing customer satisfaction through a gift-with-purchase strategy. You will discover effective techniques to implement a compelling &#8220;free product with purchase&#8221; promotion within your Magento 2 store. By utilizing this strategy, you can provide your customers with an attractive incentive to choose your business while enjoying an additional product at no cost.</p>



<p>Furthermore, we will guide you on how to seamlessly integrate the <strong><em>Free Product With Purchase of Another Product in Magento 2</em></strong> feature into your online store, ensuring a smooth and rewarding shopping experience for your valued customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive Guide to Magento 2 Free Product Offers</h2>



<p>Comprehensive Guide to Magento 2 Free Product Offers&#8221; provides step-by-step instructions on creating free product promotions, configuring rules, enhancing customer experience, and maximizing sales through Magento 2&#8217;s advanced eCommerce features and tools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the free gift-with-purchase in marketing?</h2>



<p>When individuals visit a retail establishment or browse an online store to make a purchase, sales techniques like reduced prices, discounts, or complimentary gifts-with-purchase are frequently employed to attract them into buying more. This strategy achieves two main goals:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Motivating customers to make additional purchases to obtain added value, such as gifts, without increasing the overall cost.</li>



<li>Sparking customers&#8217; interest and prompting them to complete a purchase, effectively converting them from potential buyers to engaged shoppers.</li>
</ul>



<p>By expressing gratitude towards customers through thoughtful gifts, businesses can reap substantial advantages and generate valuable leads. However, it is important to note that gift-with-purchase strategies are commonly employed to encourage upselling. This implies that customers are eligible for additional gifts when they meet certain criteria, such as purchasing a specific number of items or reaching a designated spending threshold. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Customers who exceed a $50 expenditure will pleasantly receive an unexpected gift.</li>



<li>The acquisition of a foundation palette entitles customers to a complimentary mini-size lipstick.</li>
</ul>



<p>These tactics serve as effective incentives for customers to enhance their shopping experience by adding more products to their carts, particularly for items that are typically lower in value or have slower sales rates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of gift-with-purchase for eCommerce businesses?</h2>



<p>As mentioned previously, incorporating gift-with-purchase strategies is a vital element of a robust customer engagement system, enabling the establishment of strong and lasting relationships with customers.</p>



<p>The remarkable advantages of providing promotional products as rewards for customers&#8217; purchases are evident. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the gift-with-purchase approach, let&#8217;s explore some compelling statistics obtained from Quality Logo Products.</p>



<p>In summary, there are five key advantages associated with gift-with-purchase tactics, making it an indispensable technique to include in your comprehensive marketing arsenal.</p>



<p>Moreover, we will provide you with valuable insights on <strong><em>How to Get a </em></strong>Free Product With the <strong><em>Purchase of Another Product on Magento 2</em></strong>, equipping you with the knowledge to successfully implement this feature in your online store.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enhances the perceived brand value for customers: Unlike traditional promotions like discounts or price reductions, the inclusion of an additional gift elevates the perceived value for the recipient, providing them with a greater sense of worth.</li>



<li>Boosts the conversion rate of the business: When customers perceive their purchase as having added value, they are more inclined to complete the transaction. Gifts make your offer more enticing, amplifying the purchasing power and driving conversions.</li>



<li>Stimulates repeat purchases: Customers often try and develop a liking for the gifted products, often presented in mini-sized or sample versions. This experience increases the likelihood of them returning to purchase the full-sized product or additional items after enjoying the gift.</li>



<li>Strengthens the brand&#8217;s customer loyalty program: Apart from being an effective sales technique, the inclusion of a valuable gift-with-purchase serves as a tangible expression of appreciation and gratitude towards customers for their trust and continued patronage.</li>



<li>Complements the brand&#8217;s upselling strategy: Free gifts serve as an ideal incentive for upselling customers. They possess the same purchasing power as substantial discounts or price reductions, yet offer distinct advantages to e-commerce businesses in terms of profit margins.</li>
</ol>



<p>Along with the aforementioned benefits, gift-with-purchase promotions can be customized to align with the specific marketing goals of a business.</p>



<p>In other words, there are diverse approaches to utilizing and leveraging additional gifts beyond the scope of upselling and brand loyalty programs. For instance, you can:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Introduce a new, updated, or older version of your desired product as a gift to gather valuable customer feedback and data.</li>



<li>Highlight low-cost items by offering them as complimentary gifts with customers&#8217; orders, promoting their visibility and desirability.</li>



<li>Delight loyal customers by presenting them with exclusive and limited-edition product gifts, adding an extra layer of value during specific periods of purchase.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why does the free “gift-with-purchase” work?</h2>



<p>The effectiveness of gift-with-purchase promotions lies in the appeal of receiving something &#8220;complementary&#8221; alongside a purchase. In reality, customers, including ourselves, perceive a greater sense of value when they receive a gift with their purchase, even if the actual value of the gift is minimal, as opposed to solely receiving a discount or price reduction.</p>



<p>Additionally, providing additional gifts with customer orders proves to be a cost-effective approach for retailers, creating a perception of heightened value compared to offering discounts alone. Consequently, gift-with-purchase promotions serve as a versatile sales tactic for retailers, offering a range of benefits in attracting and retaining customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to get free product-with-purchase for your Magento 2 store?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Create a new Cart Price Rule for the promotion</h3>



<p>Firstly, log in to your Admin Account and select Marketing &gt; Promotions &gt; Cart Price Rule from the left sidebar.</p>



<p>Next, click the &#8220;Add New Rule&#8221; button to start setting up the new rule for the gift-with-purchase promotion.</p>



<p>This will take you to the &#8220;New Cart Price Rule&#8221; page where you need to complete the settings of 4 tabs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Rule information</li>



<li>&nbsp;Conditions</li>



<li>&nbsp;Actions</li>



<li>&nbsp;Labels</li>
</ul>



<p>Fill in the required fields for the &#8220;Rule Information&#8221; tab, just like you would when creating any new Cart Price Rule.</p>



<p>If you are applying several cart price rules simultaneously, it&#8217;s recommended to set the activation time and rule priority for the new rule to manage your rules better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Set up Cart Price Conditions on the Condition Tab</h3>



<p>On the Condition tab, retailers need to configure the conditions to trigger the rules. This means that the gift-with-purchase offer on the website is only available when all the conditions are met.</p>



<p>Like other cart price rules, you can specify the scope of the new Cart Price Rule using four options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Product attribute combination</li>



<li>Product sub-selection</li>



<li>Cart Attribute</li>



<li>Condition combination</li>
</ul>



<p>You can add as many cart price rule conditions as needed by clicking on the (+) icon. To remove any condition, click on the (x) icon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Configure the Cart Price Actions on the Actions tab</h3>



<p>Once you have established the conditions for the gift-with-purchase promotion, the next step is to configure the actions on the Actions tab. These actions will be applied to customers&#8217; orders on the storefront when all the specified conditions are met.</p>



<p>First, select Apply = <a href="https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/v2.3/marketing/price-rules-cart-buy-x-get-y-free.html">Buy X get Y free</a> (discount amount is Y). This will allow customers to receive a free item when they purchase another item. For example, if they purchase X number of items, they will receive a quantity of Y for free.</p>



<p>Next, fill in the following details for your gift-with-purchase promotion:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Discount Amount: The number of free products customers will receive for their purchase</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Maximum Qty Discount is Applied To: The maximum number of times customers can apply this discount</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Discount Qty Step (Buy X): The number of items customers must purchase to receive the free product</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Apply to Shipping Amount = Yes: The promotion will be applied to the subtotal and shipping amount separately</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Discard subsequent rules: Decide whether to restrict the application of other existing discounts with this new cart price rule</li>
</ul>



<p>Another aspect that can be taken into consideration is the inclusion of an additional condition related to Free Shipping when implementing the &#8220;How to Get Free Product With Purchase of Another Product in Magento 2&#8221; feature. This condition allows for more flexibility in the gift-with-purchase campaign.</p>



<p>If the Free Shipping option is set to &#8220;No,&#8221; then free shipping will not be applicable to items included in the gift-with-purchase promotion.</p>



<p>If the Free Shipping option is set to &#8220;For matching items only,&#8221; then free shipping will be available exclusively for items that fulfill all the conditions outlined in the rule.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if the Free Shipping option is set to &#8220;For shipment with matching items,&#8221; then free shipping will be provided for shipments that include the qualifying items.</p>



<p>By incorporating this additional condition, merchants can tailor their gift-with-purchase campaigns to align with their specific shipping policies and customer preferences.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to offer a &#8220;Buy 2 Get 1 Free&#8221; promotion on your website, with no maximum number of free items gifted, the cart price rule would be set up as follows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Apply = Buy X get Y free (discount amount is Y)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Discount amount = 1</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Maximum Quantity Discount is Applied = 0</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Discount Qty Step (Buy X) = 2</li>
</ul>



<p>Check out more examples of different gift-with-purchase offers for your e-store on the backend.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Set the conditions for the products applied to the new Cart Price Rule</h3>



<p>Towards the end of the Actions tab, you will find the option to configure the settings for this action. Retailers have the flexibility to define rules for particular items on their websites, enabling them to provide a &#8220;free gift-with-purchase&#8221; promotion according to their desired criteria.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Set the Cart Price Labels in the Labels section</h3>



<p>To assign the rule label for all store views, simply enter the desired text within the designated area provided for the &#8220;Default Rule Label for All Store Views&#8221; section. In case your online store has multiple store views, you can also customize and set specific labels for each of them by utilizing the dedicated &#8220;Store View Specific Labels&#8221; section. This allows you to tailor the rule labels according to the unique characteristics of each store view.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 6: Save and apply the new Rule</h3>



<p>Once you have finished following the aforementioned steps, proceed by clicking the &#8220;Save Rule&#8221; button. This action will effectively save and activate the rule on your e-commerce website, ensuring its implementation and functionality as intended.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bottom line!</h2>



<p>In summary, offering a gift-with-purchase is a proven strategy for businesses to increase their visibility, retain customers, and boost sales. However, it&#8217;s important to make sure that the gift is attractive and relevant to the customers.
