<p>Magento is a popular platform used for creating online stores due to its advanced technology, frequent updates, and compatibility with <a href="/what-is-magento-commerce-cloud/">Magento Commerce Cloud</a>. It is well-known for eCommerce innovation, having powered more than 760,000 websites globally, including large corporations like Coca-Cola, Samsung, Ford, and Nike. Despite competition from other shopping cart solutions, Magento is still a preferred option for many eCommerce merchants and developers. In this article, we will explore the frameworks that Magento utilizes to enhance its features, such as Magento 1 and Magento 2, which are both built on the PHP-based Zend Framework. We will also discuss <strong><em>what is Magento Framework in PHP</em></strong>.</p>



<p>The Magento platform has a large and active developer community, which has contributed to the creation of a broad ecosystem of extensions and plugins that extend the platform&#8217;s functionality. These extensions cover areas like marketing, SEO, shipping, and payment integrations.</p>



<p>One of the challenges of working with Magento is its complexity. Due to its vast feature set and customization capabilities, the platform can be challenging to learn and use. Nevertheless, with the assistance of the developer community and abundant documentation and tutorials available online, developers can easily become proficient in working with the platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Magento Framework in PHP</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is Magento?</h3>



<p>Magento is a highly customizable eCommerce platform that can be used under both open-source and commercial licenses. It was first introduced by Varien, Inc. in August 2007 and has since undergone continuous development and released various products and versions. The Community Edition 1.0, which is free to download, was released in March 2008, and one year later, the platform launched the Enterprise Edition for commercial use. Both options are widely used for building eCommerce websites. Magento 2 was announced in 2010 and a beta version was released on GitHub, encouraging developers in the Magento community to contribute to the project.</p>



<p>Magento 2 is a result of many independent developers working together. In 2015, the merchant beta version of Magento 2 was released, bringing significant improvements that met modern architecture approaches and fit unique business requirements. Magento has been around for over a decade and while it shares similarities with popular CMSs like WordPress, Joomla!, and Drupal, it is more than just a CMS. It can be referred to as an eCommerce content management framework (CMF) as it offers a wide range of functions, customizability, scalability, and deep integration. In short, Magento is a powerful eCommerce platform that helps design unique online stores to solve specific business problems.</p>



<p>To answer the question, <strong><em>What is Magento Framework in PHP</em></strong>? Magento is an open-source eCommerce platform built on PHP, a popular programming language used for web development. Magento Framework is the underlying technology that powers the Magento platform, providing developers with a set of tools and libraries to build and customize eCommerce solutions. The framework enables developers to create complex eCommerce websites with advanced functionality such as product catalog management, order processing, payment integration, and more. In short, the Magento framework PHP-based eCommerce framework provides the foundation for creating powerful and scalable online stores.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is Magento built on?</h3>



<p>Magento owes its popularity to its robust architecture, underlying technologies, and modular structure. PHP, a widely-used web development language, forms the backbone of Magento&#8217;s backend due to its affordability, flexibility, scalability, and simplicity. PHP boasts of a vast standard library and a variety of frameworks like Zend, Yii, Phalcon, PHPixie, Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter. While Magento was initially developed on PHP 5, recent versions like Magento 2.4.0, released in July 2020, run on PHP 7.4.</p>



<p>The Magento database employs the Entity-attribute-Value (EAV) model, which provides flexibility in using properties and is particularly essential for eCommerce websites. Though the EAV model may take some time to get used to, it enables developers to use custom attributes more easily. Magento also utilizes MySQL database triggers to enhance database access during reindexing. MySQL is a popular database management system among developers.</p>



<p>Magento&#8217;s modular architecture provides the flexibility that developers and merchants require for customization. Each module contains PHP and XML files that support specific business features and are designed for a unique function. As such, adding, removing, or enabling/disabling a function has minimal impact on the overall operation of the platform. For both developers and merchants, modules are the central units of customization in Magento.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is Magento 1, 2 Framework in PHP?</h3>



<p>In brief, a PHP framework is a set of pre-written code, functions, classes, and components that help expedite software development. This enables PHP developers to work more efficiently by eliminating the need to write repetitive code. <strong><em>Magento PHP framework</em></strong> an open-source e-commerce platform based on PHP is a widely used framework for creating e-commerce websites. Furthermore, using a framework like Magento enhances the readability and comprehensibility of the code for other developers working on the same project.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Magento 1 &#8211; Choosing Zend Framework</h4>



<p>Back in 2007 when Magento 1 began its development, there weren&#8217;t as many PHP frameworks available as there are now. The prominent frameworks during that period were CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Symfony 1, and Zend Framework.</p>



<p><a href="https://book.cakephp.org/1.2/en/The-Manual/Beginning-With-CakePHP/What-is-CakePHP-Why-Use-it.html">CakePHP</a> and <a href="https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/overview/at_a_glance.html#:~:text=CodeIgniter%20is%20an%20Application%20Framework&amp;text=Its%20goal%20is%20to%20enable,structure%20to%20access%20these%20libraries.">CodeIgniter</a> were preferred for rapid application development because of their simple architectures. Symfony 1 was relatively new and its architecture was not as sophisticated as it is today.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://framework.zend.com/about.1.html">Zend Framework</a>, on the other hand, was more suitable for developing enterprise-level applications, with a focus on performance, extensibility, and security.</p>



<p>Given that Magento 1 aimed to be a stable, flexible, and well-structured eCommerce platform, the development team found that the Zend Framework was the best match for their objectives.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Magento 1 didn&#8217;t rely entirely on the Zend Framework but instead utilized its components to construct the platform rather than the framework as a whole.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Magento 2 &#8211; Zend Framework and Magento Framework</h4>



<p>After its initial release in 2008, Magento began developing Magento 2 about two years later. Unlike an ordinary update, Magento 2 was created with significant changes and a clear goal: to update the underlying architecture and keep up with modern PHP applications, ensuring the long-term growth of the platform.</p>



<p>Despite the release of Zend Framework 2 in 2012 and Zend Framework 3 in 2016, Magento 2 continued to rely on the support of the Zend Framework 1 component, which the development team found to be suitable for their needs. However, instead of relying solely on Zend Framework, Magento 2 has been striving to become a self-sufficient framework by using its own adapters and interfaces.</p>



<p>Recently, Magento 2 has been working to replace Zend Framework components with native PHP executions whenever possible. The Magento Framework provides a robust range of functionality that simplifies the development of modules related to business logic, controlling how application components connect, such as request flow, indexing, routing, caching, and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final thoughts</h2>



<p>In summary, Magento is a reliable e-commerce solution that offers merchants a flexible and sturdy platform to sell their products online. With its wide range of pre-built features, customization options, and active developer community, it is a favored choice for businesses of all scales. Despite its complexity, the advantages of the platform make it a valuable investment for merchants seeking to elevate their e-commerce enterprise.</p>



<p>In reality, the framework that Magento 1 and 2 were built on is not as important. Whether you are a merchant or developer working with Magento, it should be viewed as an independent system rather than being dependent on the framework used. However, it is worth noting that Magento is built on the Magento Framework, which is a PHP-based eCommerce framework that provides a set of tools and libraries to build and customize eCommerce solutions. Therefore, to answer the question <strong><em>What is Magento Framework in PHP</em></strong>? it is a powerful eCommerce framework that provides the foundation for creating complex online stores with advanced functionality. While the framework itself may not be as crucial for merchants or developers to understand, it is recommended to always use the official APIs provided by the Magento Framework. This ensures that any customizations made to the system are compatible with future updates and helps maintain the security and stability of the Magento platform.</p>



<p>While having a thorough understanding of the Zend Framework can help in understanding the relationship between the framework and Magento better, it is not necessary for working with the platform.</p>
