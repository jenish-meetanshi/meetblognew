<p>Magento has long been the leading platform in the eCommerce industry, with countless businesses relying on its functionality and success. However, as with any technology, progress never stops and updates are necessary to stay competitive in the market. This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento#Magento_2">Magento 2</a> comes into play. <strong><em>Why Migrate from Magento 1 to Magento 2</em></strong>? While many businesses may still be using the stable version of Magento 1, it is important to consider upgrading to Magento 2 for the benefits it offers. One of the main reasons to upgrade is the cost of Magento 2. <a href="/how-much-does-magento-2-cost/">How Much Does Magento 2 Cost</a>? This article aims to assist those who are unsure about whether to make the switch or continue using Magento 1. The decision ultimately comes down to whether to upgrade to the latest version or stick with the tried and true version.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Migrate from Magento 1 to Magento 2: The Benefits</h2>



<p>Are you wondering <strong><em>why migrate from Magento 1 to Magento 2</em></strong>?, Magento 2 is the latest version of the eCommerce platform, offering advanced marketing tools and capabilities. It was designed to provide a more effective way to manage the appearance, functionality, and content of your online business, while also improving performance, scalability, and security.</p>



<p>When upgrading from <strong><em>Magento 1 to Magento 2 migration</em></strong>, you will notice several key changes, including:</p>



<p>• An improvement in the technology level</p>



<p>• Enhanced backend and frontend modularity</p>



<p>• Increased performance</p>



<p>Magento 2 has established itself as a game-changer in the eCommerce industry, with a focus on catering to larger enterprises. New features are added to Magento 2 every three months for both the Community and Enterprise Edition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Comparison of Magento 1 and 2: Determining the Need for an Upgrade</h2>



<p>Deciding whether or not to upgrade to Magento 2 and when to do so, depends on various factors. If your current Magento 1.x version:</p>



<p>• Is functioning smoothly.</p>



<p>• Does not have any problematic features.</p>



<p>• Is generating good orders and revenue.</p>



<p>• Is operating under an updated version.</p>



<p>Then, as of Q2 2017, you can continue using it for a few more months without the need to rush into upgrading. However, you should start planning for an upgrade if you are thinking long-term.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On the other hand, upgrading is urgent if:</h3>



<p>• You are experiencing performance issues with your current eCommerce store.</p>



<p>• You are planning to launch a new eCommerce business.</p>



<p>• You are aiming to implement bigger modifications.</p>



<p>• Your current system is outdated.</p>



<p>Even if you are not experiencing any issues with your previous version, it is recommended to upgrade as the new Magento 2.x version offers new opportunities, innovations, and a number of features that allow you to better serve your customers. <a href="https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-migration-service">Magento migration service</a> is a great solution for upgrading to the latest version of Magento.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is the transition of your eCommerce store to Magento 2 a challenging process?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it: migrating can be a tedious and time-consuming process, even when moving between two versions of the same system.</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges is leaving behind all the customized designs and features of the previous version, and having to rebuild them in the new version.</p>



<p>However, migrating from Magento 1.x to Magento 2.x also presents an opportunity to transfer products, databases, and attributes, which can ultimately improve your eCommerce store.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Magento 2 can be a great opportunity:</h3>



<p>• If you want to improve your online store in general.</p>



<p>• If there are unnecessary features in your store.</p>



<p>• If you have been wanting to add a specific feature for a while.</p>



<p>• If you have done everything the best possible way.</p>



<p>Despite these opportunities, small businesses may want to wait before migrating in order to avoid the hassle. However, as technology progresses, migrating becomes more necessary, and holding on to an older version for too long can be detrimental to your business.</p>



<p>The data migration tool makes it easier to migrate databases between versions, and migrating products, customers, and orders are relatively straightforward. However, it&#8217;s recommended to entrust experts to handle the migration process as your database and products are valuable assets of your business and should be handled with care.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magento Development </h2>



<p>Despite being available since 2015, Magento 2 is still considered relatively new in terms of its widespread adoption and usage. As a result, there are relatively few individuals or companies with expertise in developing and installing Magento 2 extensions. Additionally, the development and implementation of Magento 2 often come with a high cost.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A dedicated budget for Magento 2 development is necessary</h2>



<p>The switch to Magento 2 for customized solutions requires an experienced team of professionals who are experts in the field. Because of the limited number of experts available, the cost of development is usually higher. The cost of development is difficult to predict as it depends on the specific requirements and features needed for the project. On average, development on the Magento 2 platform tends to be around 1.5-2 times more expensive than the basic version. Additionally, modules for Magento 2 tend to be more expensive than those for Magento 1 due to their limited availability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magento community factor</h2>



<p>1. Magento is a widely recognized and highly advanced eCommerce software, thanks to the extensive professional community that supports it. For the past 9 years, users have been utilizing the Magento 1.x version and have had access to assistance for all related issues. The same is true for Magento 2, which is developed on GitHub and constantly updated by professionals with new features and patches.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re still using Magento 1.x, here are 15 reasons why you should upgrade to the new version:</p>



<p>1. Increased scalability and improved performance: A significant amount of traffic is lost when a website takes longer than 3 seconds to load, which is the standard time. However, with Magento 2.x, the loading time for the homepage, product pages, and category pages are only 1.5 seconds for eCommerce websites.</p>



<p>2. Responsive and search engine-friendly design: Magento 2 has a responsive frontend design that makes it easy to browse on all devices. This improves Magento 2&#8217;s credibility, as Google algorithms now favor mobile-friendly websites in search rankings. The responsive design also enhances the user experience.</p>



<p>3. Streamlined checkout process: The checkout process has become more user-friendly, allowing customers to check out without registration. Magento 2 can identify customers based on their email addresses, and also allows for easy registration after checkout.</p>



<p>4. Elastic search: This feature improves the quality of searches and user experience, and can handle 33 languages. The same functionality is also available for third-party extensions for Magento 2.</p>



<p>5. Easier and cheaper extension updates: Installing new extensions and modules is simpler and more cost-effective compared to Magento 1. x. Even basic extensions for Magento 1. x can take a long time to install, and conflicts with other extensions were common. With Magento 2, the process has become easier and more functional.</p>



<p>6. Data migration tool: Magento 2 makes it easy to migrate a database, products, customers, and orders from one version to another. However, we recommend that you entrust experts to handle the migration process, as the database and products are the most valuable assets of a business.</p>



<p>7. Ajax add-to-cart: With Magento 1, the page reloads every time an item is added to the cart, which can lead to customers abandoning their carts. Magento 2&#8217;s Ajax add-to-cart system allows items to be added to the cart without page reloading, improving the user experience.</p>



<p>8. Simpler navigation: Magento 2 is more user-friendly and modern for online store owners, even for those with less knowledge and experience. The admin interface for Magento 1 is more complex compared to Magento 2.</p>



<p>9. Split database solution: In Magento 1, the database for admin, customers, and developers is the same, which can lead to database overload. This can affect both the admin and customers. With Magento 2, it is possible to use three separate databases for product data, orders, and customers, reducing the risk of overload.</p>



<p>10. Dashboard: The new system provides all necessary information in one place, including lifetime sales, average order amount, last orders, top search terms, most viewed products, and new customers. The financial overview is also displayed on the homepage, providing an easy way to view the overall status of the business.</p>



<p>11. Simpler product upload: Magento 2 makes it easy to create new products with a step-by-step tutorial, and also allows for the addition of product videos along with photos.</p>



<p>12. More efficient customization: Magento 2 allows merchants to offer personalized payment methods and monitor on-site behavior.</p>



<p>13. Lower Hardware Needs: Magento 2 has been found to provide the same level of performance with less hardware requirements, which can result in lower initial and ongoing costs for the system. Even if you are using a hosting service, you will find the newer version to be more cost-effective.</p>



<p>14. Improved Testing: When working with a more advanced version that includes customized features, extensions, and modules with a high volume of traffic, it is crucial to minimize risks and bugs. Magento 2 makes this easier by providing a more efficient testing process. In the past, it was challenging to check if new features and modules would conflict with the existing system, but this is no longer the case with Magento 2.</p>



<p>15. Simplified Integration: Magento 2 makes it easier to integrate various systems, such as ERP and CRM, making the process more streamlined and efficient.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When does Magento 1. x expire?</h2>



<p>The end of support for Magento 1 is imminent, making Magento 2 the preferred choice for new eCommerce businesses. Magento will no longer provide official support for the older version, leaving it vulnerable to security threats. While it is possible to hire developers to create custom security patches, it is an added expense and workload for your business. In the long run, migrating to Magento 2 offers greater stability and peace of mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, it is important to consider the long-term sustainability of your eCommerce store. As Magento 1.x will no longer receive official support and updates, it is only a matter of time before it becomes outdated and potentially exposes your store to security risks.</p>



<p>If you are wondering <strong><em>why migrate from Magento 1 to Magento 2</em></strong>, it is because Magento 2 is the future of eCommerce, offering better performance, scalability, and security. <strong><em>Migration from Magento 1 to Magento 2</em></strong> may require significant development efforts, but it is necessary for the stability and longevity of your store.</p>



<p>If you are currently running a customized version of Magento 1 and your store is performing well, it may be wise to plan for migration within the next year or two. However, if your store is already running on an outdated version of Magento 1, it is recommended to migrate as soon as possible.</p>
